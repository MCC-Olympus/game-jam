To make sure that everyone knows how to navigate GitHub and this project, I think it would be good for everyone to
practice submitting code by updating this file. You should clone this repository, checkout the dev branch, add your
name to the bottom of this file, commit the changes, and push to origin/dev. After, I will merge the changes from dev
into main after I check that nothing is broken.

Also, make sure you can run game_jam/main.py
